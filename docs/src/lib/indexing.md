## General rules

The following rules explain target functionality of how `getindex`, `setindex!`, `view`,
and broadcasting are intended to work with `DataFrame`, `SubDataFrame` and `DataFrameRow` objects.

The rules for a valid type of index into a column are the following:
* a value, later denoted as `col`:
    * a `Symbol`;
    * an `Integer` that is not `Bool`;
* a vector, later denoted as `cols`:
    * a vector of `Symbol` (does not have to be a subtype of `AbstractVector{Symbol}`);
    * a vector of `Integer` other than `Bool` (does not have to be a subtype of `AbstractVector{<:Integer}`);
    * a vector of `Bool` that has to be a subtype of `AbstractVector{Bool}`;
    * a regular expression, which gets expanded to a vector of matching column names;
    * a `Not` expression (see [InvertedIndices.jl](https://github.com/mbauman/InvertedIndices.jl));
    * an `All` or `Between` expression (see [DataAPI.jl](https://github.com/JuliaData/DataAPI.jl));
    * a colon literal `:`.

The rules for a valid type of index into a row are the following:
* a value, later denoted as `row`:
    * an `Integer` that is not `Bool`;
* a vector, later denoted as `rows`:
    * a vector of `Integer` other than `Bool` (does not have to be a subtype of `AbstractVector{<:Integer}`);
    * a vector of `Bool` that has to be a subtype of `AbstractVector{Bool}`;
    * a `Not` expression;
    * a colon literal `:`;
* an exclamation mark `!`.

Additionally it is allowed to index into an `AbstractDataFrame` using a two-dimensional `CartesianIndex`.

In the descriptions below `df` represents a `DataFrame`, `sdf` is a `SubDataFrame` and `dfr` is a `DataFrameRow`.

`:` always expands to `axes(df, 1)` or `axes(sdf, 1)`.

`df.col` works like `df[!, col]` and `sdf.col` works like `sdf[!, col]` in all cases except that
`df.col .= v` and `sdf.col .= v` perform in-place broadcasting if `col` is present in `df`/`sdf` and is a valid identifier.

## `getindex` and `view`

The following list specifies the behavior of `getindex` and `view` operations depending on argument types.

In particular a description explicitly mentions that the data is *copied* or *reused without copying*.

For performance reasons, accessing, via `getindex` or `view`, a single `row` and multiple `cols` of a `DataFrame`,
a `SubDataFrame` or a `DataFrameRow` always returns a `DataFrameRow` (which is a view type).

`getindex` on `DataFrame`:
* `df[row, col]` -> the value contained in row `row` of column `col`, the same as `df[!, col][row]`;
* `df[CartesianIndex(row, col)]` -> the same as `df[row,col]`;
* `df[row, cols]` -> a `DataFrameRow` with parent `df`;
* `df[rows, col]` -> a copy of the vector `df[!, col]` with only the entries corresponding to `rows` selected,
                     the same as `df[!, col][rows]`;
* `df[rows, cols]` -> a `DataFrame` containing copies of columns `cols` with only the entries corresponding to `rows` selected;
* `df[!, col]` -> the vector contained in column `col` returned without copying; the same as `df.col` if `col` is a valid identifier.
* `df[!, cols]` -> create a new `DataFrame` with columns `cols` without copying of columns;
                   the same as `select(df, cols, copycols=false)`.

`view` on `DataFrame`:
* `@view df[row, col]` -> a `0`-dimensional view into `df[!, col]` in row `row`, the same as `view(df[!, col], row)`;
* `@view df[CartesianIndex(row, col)]` -> the same as `@view df[row, col]`;
* `@view df[row, cols]` -> the same as `df[row, cols]`;
* `@view df[rows, col]` -> a view into `df[!, col]` with `rows` selected, the same as `view(df[!, col], rows)`;
* `@view df[rows, cols]` -> a `SubDataFrame` with `rows` selected with parent `df`;
* `@view df[!, col]` -> a view into `df[!, col]`  with all rows.
* `@view df[!, cols]` -> the same as `@view df[:, cols]`.

`getindex` on `SubDataFrame`:
* `sdf[row, col]` -> a value contained in row `row` of column `col`;
* `sdf[CartesianIndex(row, col)]` -> the same as `sdf[row,col]`;
* `sdf[row, cols]` -> a `DataFrameRow` with parent `parent(sdf)`;
* `sdf[rows, col]` -> a copy of `sdf[!, col]` with only rows `rows` selected, the same as `sdf[!, col][rows]`;
* `sdf[rows, cols]` -> a `DataFrame` containing columns `cols` and `sdf[rows, col]` as a vector for each `col` in `cols`;
* `sdf[!, col]` -> a view of entries corresponding to `sdf` in the vector `parent(sdf)[!, col]`;
                   the same as `sdf.col` if `col` is a valid identifier.
* `sdf[!, cols]` -> create a new `SubDataFrame` with columns `cols`, the same parent as `sdf`, and the same rows selected;
                    the same as `select(sdf, cols, copycols=false)`.


`view` on `SubDataFrame`:
* `@view sdf[row, col]` -> a `0`-dimensional view into `df[!, col]` at row `row`, the same as `view(sdf[!, col], row)`;
* `@view sdf[CartesianIndex(row, col)]` -> the same as `@view sdf[row, col]`;
* `@view sdf[row, cols]` -> a `DataFrameRow` with parent `parent(sdf)`;
* `@view sdf[rows, col]` -> a view into `sdf[!, col]` vector with `rows` selected, the same as `view(sdf[!, col], rows)`;
* `@view sdf[rows, cols]` -> a `SubDataFrame` with parent `parent(sdf)`;
* `@view sdf[!, col]` -> a view into `sdf[!, col]` vector with all rows.
* `@view sdf[!, cols]` -> the same as `@view sdf[:, cols]`.

`getindex` on `DataFrameRow`:
* `dfr[col]` -> the value contained in column `col` of `dfr`; the same as `dfr.col` if `col` is a valid identifier;
* `dfr[cols]` -> a `DataFrameRow` with parent `parent(dfr)`;

`view` on `DataFrameRow`:
* `@view dfr[col]` -> a `0`-dimensional view into `parent(dfr)[DataFrames.row(dfr), col]`;
* `@view dfr[cols]` -> a `DataFrameRow` with parent `parent(dfr)`;

Note that views created with columns selector set to `:` change their columns'
count if columns are added/removed/renamed in the parent; if column selector is other than `:`
then view points to selected columns by their number at the moment of creation of the view.

## `setindex!`

The following list specifies the behavior of `setindex!` operations depending on argument types.

In particular a description explicitly mentions if the assignment is *in-place*.

Note that if a `setindex!` operation throws an error the target data frame may be partially changed
so it is unsafe to use it afterwards (the column length correctness will be preserved).

`setindex!` on `DataFrame`:
* `df[row, col] = v` -> set value of `col` in row `row` to `v` in-place;
* `df[CartesianIndex(row, col)] = v` -> the same as `df[row, col] = v`;
* `df[row, cols] = v` -> set row `row` of columns `cols` in-place; the same as `dfr = df[row, cols]; dfr[:] = v`;
* `df[rows, col] = v` -> set rows `rows` of column `col` in-place; `v` must be an `AbstractVector`;
* `df[rows, cols] = v` -> set rows `rows` of columns `cols` in-place; `v` must be an `AbstractMatrix` or an `AbstractDataFrame`
                      (in this case column names must match);
* `df[!, col] = v` -> replaces `col` with `v` without copying
                      (with the exception that if `v` is an `AbstractRange` it gets converted to a `Vector`);
                      also if `col` is a `Symbol` that is not present in `df` then a new column in `df` is created and holds `v`;
                      equivalent to `df.col = v` if `col` is a valid identifier;
                      this is allowed if `ncol(df) == 0 || length(v) == nrow(df)`;
* `df[!, cols] = v` -> replaces existing columns `cols` in data frame `df` with copying;
                       `v` must be an `AbstractMatrix` or an `AbstractDataFrame`
                       (in the latter case column names must match);

Note that only `df[!, col] = v` and `df.col = v` can be used to add a new column to a `DataFrame`.
In particular as `df[:, col] = v` is an in-place operation it does not add a column `v` to a `DataFrame` if `col` is missing
(an error is thrown if such operation is attempted).

`setindex!` on `SubDataFrame`:
* `sdf[row, col] = v` -> set value of `col` in row `row` to `v` in-place;
* `sdf[CartesianIndex(row, col)] = v` -> the same as `sdf[row, col] = v`;
* `sdf[row, cols] = v` -> the same as `dfr = df[row, cols]; dfr[:] = v` in-place;
* `sdf[rows, col] = v` -> set rows `rows` of column `col`, in-place; `v` must be an abstract vector;
* `sdf[rows, cols] = v` -> set rows `rows` of columns `cols` in-place;
                           `v` can be an `AbstractMatrix` or `v` can be `AbstractDataFrame` when column names must match;

Note that `sdf[!, col] = v`, `sdf[!, cols] = v` and `sdf.col = v` are not allowed as `sdf` can be only modified in-place.

`setindex!` on `DataFrameRow`:
* `dfr[col] = v` -> set value of `col` in row `row` to `v` in-place;
                    equivalent to `dfr.col = v` if `col` is a valid identifier;
* `dfr[cols] = v` -> set values of entries in columns `cols` in `dfr` by elements of `v` in place;
                     `v` can be:
                     1) a `Tuple` or an `AbstractArray`,
                        in which cases it must have a number of elements equal to `length(dfr)`,
                     2) an `AbstractDict`, in which case column names must match,
                     3) a `NamedTuple` or `DataFrameRow`, in which case column names and order must match;

## Broadcasting

The following broadcasting rules apply to `AbstractDataFrame` objects:
* `AbstractDataFrame` behaves in broadcasting like a two-dimensional collection compatible with matrices.
* If an `AbstractDataFrame` takes part in broadcasting then a `DataFrame` is always produced as a result.
  In this case the requested broadcasting operation produces an object with exactly two dimensions.
  An exception is when an `AbstractDataFrame` is used only as a source of broadcast assignment into an object
  of dimensionality higher than two.
* If multiple `AbstractDataFrame` objects take part in broadcasting then they have to have identical column names.

Note that if broadcasting assignment operation throws an error the target data frame may be partially changed
so it is unsafe to use it afterwards (the column length correctness will be preserved).


Broadcasting `DataFrameRow` is currently not allowed (which is consistent with `NamedTuple`).

It is possible to assign a value to `AbstractDataFrame` and `DataFrameRow` objects using the `.=` operator.
In such an operation `AbstractDataFrame` is considered as two-dimensional and `DataFrameRow` as single-dimensional.

!!! note

    The rule above means that, similar to single-dimensional objects in Base (e.g. vectors),
    `DataFrameRow` is considered to be column-oriented.

Additional rules:
* in the `df[CartesianIndex(row, col)] .= v`, `df[row, col] .= v` syntaxes `v` is broadcasted into the contents of `df[row, col]` (this is consistent with Julia Base);
* in the `df[row, cols] .= v` syntaxes the assignment to `df` is performed in-place;
* in the `df[rows, col] .= v` and `df[rows, cols] .= v` syntaxes the assignment to `df` is performed in-place;
* in the `df[!, col] .= v` syntax column `col` is replaced by a freshly allocated vector; if `col` is `Symbol` and it is missing from `df` then a new column is added; the length of the column is always the value of `nrow(df)` before the assignment takes place;
* the `df[!, cols] .= v` syntax replaces existing columns `cols` in data frame `df` with freshly allocated vectors;
* `df.col .= v` syntax is allowed and performs in-place assignment to an existing vector `df.col`.
* in the `sdf[CartesianIndex(row, col)] .= v`, `sdf[row, col] .= v` and `sdf[row, cols] .= v` syntaxes the assignment to `sdf` is performed in-place;
* in the `sdf[rows, col] .= v` and `sdf[rows, cols] .= v` syntaxes the assignment to `sdf` is performed in-place;
* `sdf.col .= v` syntax is allowed and performs in-place assignment to an existing vector `sdf.col`.
* `dfr.col .= v` syntax is allowed and performs in-place assignment to a value extracted by `dfr.col`.

Note that `sdf[!, col] .= v` and `sdf[!, cols] .= v` syntaxes are not allowed as `sdf` can be only modified in-place.

If column indexing using `Symbol` names in `cols` is performed, the order of columns in the operation is specified
by the order of names.


## Indexing `GroupedDataFrame`s

[`GroupedDataFrame`](@ref) implements the `AbstractDict` interface and so supports additional methods for indexing:

* `gd[i::Integer]` -> Get the `i`th group
* `gd[key::NamedTuple]` -> Get the group corresponding to the dictionary key `key` (see [`keys(::GroupedDataFrame)`](@ref)).
  The fields of the `NamedTuple` must match the grouping columns columns passed to [`groupby`](@ref)
  (including order).
* `gd[key::Tuple]` -> Same as previous, but omitting the names on `key`.
* `get(gd, key, default)` -> Get group by key, returning `default` if it does not exist.
